## ✅ Summary of findings

### 1) **AgriFieldNet (TorchGeo) does *not* provide class weights**

You inspected the dataset object (`dir(ds)`) and the available attributes include things like:

* `ordinal_map`
* `ordinal_cmap`
* `cmap`
* `bands`, etc.

…but **there is no attribute** such as:

* `class_weights`
* `weights`
* `class_counts`
* `pixel_counts`
* `frequency`

✅ So **class weights are NOT saved in the TorchGeo dataset object**.


### 2) What AgriFieldNet *does* provide

Even though weights aren’t included, the dataset does provide:

✅ `ordinal_map`
→ mapping raw mask IDs → contiguous indices (0..N-1)

✅ `ordinal_cmap` / `cmap`
→ class colormap and class metadata aligned with contiguous indices

So TorchGeo **handles label remapping**, but not weighting.


### 3) How to actually get class weights

Since weights aren’t stored, you must **compute them yourself**, usually from:

✅ Pixel frequencies across masks (most common), or
✅ Your processed metadata file if you saved counts in `data/processed/class_map.json`.
